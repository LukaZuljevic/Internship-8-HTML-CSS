        . Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible. But
        here we are. I'm trying my best.

        The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a
        <span>role="presentation"</span> attribute to make decorated sections
        without css. If you view source on the page, you'll see that there are a
        LOT of tables. The table tag typically is used to display tabular data
        and should NOT be used as a layout method. However, since I am not
        allowed to use CSS, I am pretty much exclusively relying on tables for
        this purpose. The presentation role tells the browser to not expose the
        table and its tabluar children in the accessibility tree. This will make
        it easier to navigate for assistive technology.<br /><br />
        I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements from HTML 3.2 that you
        should never use. In order to be "compliant", I've added the HTML 3.2
        doctype at the top of the page:
        <span><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"></span>
        This helps give a hint to the browser that we are going to use some
        older stuff.<br /><br />
        HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as
        <span>details/summary, section, main, header</span>, and
        <span>footer</span>. So I'm just making a mess of my doctype and what I
        should be actually using!
